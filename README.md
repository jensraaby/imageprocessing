imageprocessing
===============

This repository contains various scripts and functions for image processing.
It's mainly developed for my own use during my studies but there may be parts that
others find useful.

# Matlab
- gammaTransform.m - Applies a simple gamma transform to an image
- intensityRangeTransform.m - Rescales an image's intensity between 2 levels
- noiseGen1d.m - Generates a few types of noise in 1D (Gaussian, gamma, uniform, salt & pepper)
- polarToCartestian.m - Converts an image of a circle to a rectangular plot

# Python
- xdr2mat.py: batch convert a directory of IDL XDR files to Matlab MAT files.
